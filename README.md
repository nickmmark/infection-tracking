# infection-tracking


## background
* over the last two decades several novel viral respiratory epidemics have rocked the world: [SARS Coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) (2002-2003), [H1N1 Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1), [MERS Coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus) (2012), [Wuhan Coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) (2019-2020), etc.
* collectively these viruses have causes thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in lost productivity.
* because of widespread air travel, these infections have quickly spread throughout the world, as illustrated by the spread of Wuhan coronovirus in 2019-2020

* these infections can spread readily from one person to another. ***_The central challenge of containing infection is to identifying who has been exposed to infected individuals._***
* [several mobile apps have been developed to track infections](https://jglobalbiosecurity.com/articles/10.31646/gbio.39/), however none has been especially successful.

## concept
* individuals can download an app to see information about where infections have been reported
* this app also securely tracks users locations
* this information can be used to identify if a user has been in the same location as an infected person

## app and platform design
* 
* there are two core pieces of the platform
  * a mobile app that can provide information about outbreaks and securely track locations
  * a platform that can identify exposure between infected individuals and other users

## underlying technology
* for a detailed description see here

## business case
* the app provides a free service to users, which encourages them to download it
* the app also enables privacy preserving tracking, which is a valuable service to the government
